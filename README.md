# Recogito

A Web-based tool for geo-annotating texts and/or validating the results of automated geo-parsing. You can read an introduction
to Recogito on the Pelagios project blog [here](http://pelagios-project.blogspot.co.at/2014/01/from-bordeaux-to-jerusalem-and-back.html) and
[here](http://pelagios-project.blogspot.co.at/2014/01/theres-pliny-of-room-at-bottom-1.html).

## Installation

* Recogito requires Java 1.7 installed on your machine.
* Install the [Play Framework v2.2.2](http://www.playframework.com/download). This should normally be a matter of downloading and unzipping the
  _classic_ distribution. (No need to use the version packaged with the _Typesafe Activator_.)
* Recogito depends on the _scalagios-core_ and _scalagios-gazetteer_ utility libraries from the [Scalagios](http://github.com/pelagios/scalagios)
  project. These are not yet available through a Maven repository. You need to add them manually to a `lib` folder in the `recogito` root folder.
  Build them from source using these [instructions](http://github.com/pelagios/scalagios), or drop us a line via 
  [@Pelagiosproject](https://twitter.com/pelagiosproject).
* Create a copy of the file `conf/application.conf.template` named `conf/application.conf`, and adapt the settings according to your environment.
  For the most part, the default settings should be fine. Per default, Recogito will create an empty SQLite database. If you want to set up
  Recogito with Postgres, this [Wikipage](https://github.com/pelagios/recogito/wiki/Beginner's-Guide-to-Installing-Postgres) might be of additional help.
* Start Recogito using `play start` (to start on the default port) or `play "start {portnumber}"` for a custom port.  
* Go to [http://localhost:9000/recogito](http://localhost:9000/recogito) (change the port number accordingly if you're running on a custom port).
  You should see the Recogito landing page, with a login button.

## Importing Documents

To work with Recogito, you first need to import data. When starting up with an empty database, Recogito will automatically create a single user with 
admin rights. Log in with this user (username = admin, password = admin) and go to the 'Administration' section. You should see an "Upload" button
which allows you to upload a ZIP file containing (UTF-8 encoded) plaintexts and accompanying document metadata.  

Document metadata must be provided as a JSON file. The name of the file can be chosen arbitrarily. The only requirement is that it has a
`.json` extension. The JSON structure defines the document's __title__, __description__ and __source__ properties, as well as the __parts__
the document consists of, and where in the ZIP file the text for the document (or its parts) are located.

A possible ZIP folder structure is e.g.:

```
isidore.json
texts/Isidore_Book IX.txt
texts/Isidore_Book XIII.txt
texts/Isidore_Book XIV.txt
``` 
The contents of the file `isidore.json` should look like this:

```javascript
{
  "author": "Isidore of Seville",
  "title": "Etymyologiae",
  "language": "en",
  "parts": [{
    "title": "Book IX",
    "text": "texts/Isidore_Book IX.txt"
  },{
    "title": "Book XIII",
    "text": "texts/Isidore_Book XIII.txt"
  },{
    "title": "Book XIV",
    "text": "texts/Isidore_Book XIV.txt"
  }] 
}
```

The ZIP file can also contain data for multiple documents. In this case, each document must be defined in its own JSON file.

## Importing Annotations

You can import annotations as CSV files. E.g. if you want to upload automatically generated annotations before you start 
manual annotation, or to restore the results of previous work. In general the order of the columns is irrelevant, it is only
necessary to use the correct pre-defined column labels.

An example CSV file is shown below:

```csv
gdoc_part;status;toponym;offset;gazetteer_uri;
Book IX;NOT_VERIFIED;Greek;1647;http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/59649;
Book IX;NOT_VERIFIED;Athens;1795;http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885;
Book IX;NOT_VERIFIED;Greece;1842;;
Book IX;NOT_VERIFIED;Italy;2287;http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/456048;
Book IX;NOT_VERIFIED;Salii;2371;http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/99034;
```

If the annotations pertain to a document that has parts, the ``gdoc_part`` column must match the name of the part. The other
columns match with the fields in the Recogito data model, and are (generally) optional.

## Hacking on Recogito

* To start Recogito in development mode, type `play run`
* To create an Eclipse project, type `play eclipse` 
* To create an Eclipse project with dependency's sources attached, type `play` to enter the Play console, and then `eclipse with-source=true`
