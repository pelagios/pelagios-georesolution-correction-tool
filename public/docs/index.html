      <h3>The Landing Page</h3>
      <p>The first thing you will see of Recogito is the <strong>landing page</strong> (Fig.1). This page provides an overview of the documents
        currently available in the system.</p>
      
      <div class="figure">
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-public-idx.png">  
        <p>Fig.1 Landing Page.</p>
      </div>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Documents can be grouped into different <strong>collections</strong>. You can navigate between them 
        with the <strong>collections menu</strong> on the left-hand side.</li>
    
        <li>The <strong>document list</strong> shows author, title and date information for each document. It also indicates
        the language of the document (e.g. 'en' for English, 'la' for Latin, etc.). For some documents, there is a small <span class="icon">&#xf196;</span> 
        symbol at the start of the row. This means the document is available in multiple languages. Click the row to view all available versions.</li>
      
        <li>Next to each document there document list shows the <strong>total number of toponyms tagged</strong> in the text; and the <strong>rate of 
          completion</strong>, i.e. the percentage of toponyms which have been successfully geo-located through a gazetteer (green) vs. those where 
          no gazetteer match could be identified (yellow) vs. those that have not yet been verified. Above the document list, there is a graph that 
          shows this information for the entire collection.</li>
        
        <li>At the right-hand end of the document list, two buttons labeled <strong>Map</strong> and <strong>Download</strong> allow you to view the 
          geo-located toponyms in the document on a Web map <a href="#">[Skip to 'Public Map']</a>, and to download the raw toponym data as a CSV file.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <p>Log in to Recogito through the button in the upper right hand corner. You will notice a small change in the landing page: instead of the 'Map' and
        'Download' buttons, there is now row of icons. These icons provide access to Recogito's different document views (from left to right): 
        <a href="#"><span class="icon">&#xf080;</span> Document Stats</a>, <a href="#"><span class="icon">&#xf0f6;</span> Text View</a> and 
        <a href="#"><span class="icon">&#xf0ac;</span> Geo-Resoution</a>. The fourth icon in the list <span class="icon">&#xf0ce;</span> 
        again allows you to download the raw toponym data as CSV.</p>
    
      <div class="figure"><img src="images/icons-idx.png"></div>
      
      <h3>Document Stats</h3>
      
      <p>This page lists a some basic statistics about the annotations on the document.</p>
      
      <h3>Text View</h3>
      
      <p>When you start working on a new document, the text view is usually where you will want to begin. This view is where you annotate toponyms in the text by 
        selecting them. Like in any word processing tool, you can select a text by clicking and dragging with your mouse, or by double clicking on a word.
        After selecting a piece of text, a confirmation dialog will pop up to verify wether your want to mark up the selected text as a toponym or not.</p>
        
      <p>To delete an existing annotation simply select it again. The popup dialog will now ask for confirmation whether you want to delete or not. Modifying
        an annotation - i.e. changing start, end, or merging multiple annotations into one - is equally straightforward. Just select the toponym,
        the way you want it, and the popup dialog will ask you to confirm the change.</p>
       
      <p>Some documents consist of multiple text parts. In this case, you can use
        the menu bar in the header to switch between them. (It is also possible for documents to have not text at all. In this case text view will not be available. 
        This, however, is the exception rather than the norm.) The menu bar also allows you to switch to the <a href="#">Document Stats</a> and
        <a href="#">Geo-Resoultion</a> views directly, without having to go back to the landing page.</p>
        
      <p>Underneath the menu bar is the <strong>tool bar</strong>. This allows you to switch between different modes of operation. Per default, you will start
        off in normal 'Toponym Annotation' mode. In Recogito's second annotation mode, 'Quick Toponym Annotation', you will get no popup dialog - every
        action you make will be performed without the need to confirm. You will see that, with a little bit of practice, this mode will greatly speed up your work.</p> 
        
      <p>There are a few <strong>helper functions</strong> hidden in the text view:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>When you annotate a toponym, Recogito will search for additional exact matches in the text and ask whether you want to mark those automatically, too.</li>
        <li>Recogito will always (also in Quick Mode) popup up a confirmation dialog in case your selection is very long. This is to avoid loss of 
          annotations in case you accidentially select a whole paragraph. (In which case Recogito would merge all existing annotations into one.)
        <li>A similar confirmation will popup for very short selections. This is primarily to avoid an excessive number of annotation being created 
          in case you accidentially select a very common word ('and') and are too quick confirming the automatic annotation of exact matches.</li>
      </ul>
