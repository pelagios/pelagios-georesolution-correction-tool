      <h3>The Landing Page</h3>
      <p>The first thing you will see of Recogito is the <strong>landing page</strong> (Fig.1). This page provides an overview of the documents
        currently available in the system.</p>

        <p>Fig.1 Landing Page.</p>
      </div>
      
      <ol>
        <li>Documents can be grouped into different <strong>collections</strong>. You can navigate between them 
        with the <strong>collections menu</strong> on the left-hand side.</li>
    
        <li>The <strong>document list</strong> shows author, title and date information for each document. It also indicates
        the language of the document (e.g. 'en' for English, 'la' for Latin, etc.). For some documents, there is a small <span class="icon">&#xf196;</span> 
        symbol at the start of the row. This means the document is available in multiple languages. Click the row to view all available versions.</li>
      
        <li>Next to each document there document list shows the <strong>total number of toponyms tagged</strong> in the text; and the <strong>rate of 
          completion</strong>, i.e. the percentage of toponyms which have been successfully geo-located through a gazetteer (green) vs. those where 
          no gazetteer match could be identified (yellow) vs. those that have not yet been verified. Above the document list, there is a graph that 
          shows this information for the entire collection.</li>
        
        <li>At the right-hand end of the document list, two buttons labeled <strong>Map</strong> and <strong>Download</strong> allow you to view the 
          geo-located toponyms in the document on a Web map <a href="#">[Skip to 'Public Map']</a>, and to download the raw toponym data as a CSV file.</li>
      </ol>
    
      <h3>First Steps</h3>
    
      <p>Log in to Recogito through the button in the upper right hand corner. You will notice a small change in the landing page: instead of the 'Map' and
        'Download' buttons, you will see a small row of icons. These icons provide access to Recogito's different document views.</p>
