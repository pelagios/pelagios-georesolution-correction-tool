      <h3>Landing Page</h3>
      <p>The first thing you will see of Recogito is the <strong>landing page</strong> (Fig.1). This page, which is the 
        <strong>'public view'</strong>, provides an overview of the documents currently available in the system.</p>
      
      <div class="figure">
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-public-idx.png">  
        <p>Fig.1 Landing Page.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>Documents are grouped into different <strong>collections</strong>. You can navigate between them with the 
        <strong>collections menu</strong> on the left-hand side <span class="image-marker">1</span>. The <strong>document
        list</strong> <span class="image-marker">2</span> shows author, title and date information
        for each document. It also indicates the <strong>language</strong> of the document with a small label. (E.g. 'en'
        for English, 'la' for Latin, etc.) For some documents, there is a small <span class="icon">&#xf196;</span> 
        symbol at the start of the row. This means the document is available in multiple versions - typically translations 
        in different languages. Click the row to view all available versions.</p>
      
      <p>The number next to the language label is the <strong>total number of place names (toponyms)</strong> that have 
        been tagged in the text. Next to that, a colour-coded progress bar illustrates the <strong>rate of completion</strong>, 
        i.e. the percentage of those place names which have been successfully geo-located through a gazetteer (green) vs. 
        those where no gazetteer match could be found (yellow) vs. those place names that have not yet been verified. 
        Above the document list, there is a similar, larger bar that shows this information for the entire collection
        <span class="image-marker">3</span>.</p>
        
      <p>At the right-hand side of the document list, two buttons labeled <strong>Map</strong> and <strong>Download</strong>
        <span class="image-marker">4</span> allow you to view the geo-located place names for each document on a Web map, 
        and to download the raw data as a CSV file.</p>
    
      <p>If you now log in to Recogito through the <strong>button in the upper right hand corner</strong>, you will notice a small change in the landing page: instead of the 'Map' and
        'Download' buttons, there is now a row of icons. This means that you are now in the <strong>'editing suite'</strong>, which is where the annotation and geo-resolution of documents takes place. The icons here provide access to Recogito's different areas of activity (from left to right): 
        <a href="#document-stats"><span class="icon">&#xf080;</span> Document Stats</a>, <a href="#text-annotation"><span class="icon">&#xf0f6;</span> Text Annotation</a> and 
        <a href="#geo-resolution"><span class="icon">&#xf0ac;</span> Geo-Resoution</a>. The table icon <span class="icon">&#xf0ce;</span> again allows you to download
        the raw data as a CSV file. Note that it is possible for documents to have no text at all. In this case the Text Annotation icon will be
        greyed out.</p>
      
      <a class="internal-anchor" name="document-stats"></a>
      <h3><span class="icon">&#xf080;</span> Document Stats</h3>
      
      <p>This page lists basic statistics about the annotations on the document. At the moment, it is still a work in progress.</p>
      
      <a class="internal-anchor" name="text-annotation"></a>
      <h3><span class="icon">&#xf0f6;</span> Text Annotation</h3>
      
      <p>When you start working on a new document, this is usually where you will want to begin (Fig.2). You can annotate place names in the text by selecting
        them. Like in any word processing tool, you select by clicking and dragging with your mouse, or by double clicking on a word.
        After selecting a piece of text, a confirmation dialog will pop up to verify wether your want to annotate the selected text as a place name or not
        <span class="image-marker">1</span>.</p>
        
      <div class="figure">
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-annotation.png">  
        <p>Fig.2 Text Annotation Area.</p>
      </div>
        
      <p>To delete an annotation, simply select it again. A popup dialog will ask for confirmation. Modifying an annotation (i.e. changing its
        start or end, or merging multiple annotations into one) is equally straightforward. Just select the place name the way you want it, and
        the popup dialog will ask you to confirm the change.</p>
        
      <div class="figure"><img src="images/popup-merge.png"></div>
       
      <p>Some documents consist of multiple texts. In this case, you can use the <strong>menu bar</strong> in the header to switch between them
        <span class="image-marker">2</span>. The menu bar also allows you to switch to the <a href="#document-stats">Document Stats</a> and
        <a href="#geo-resolution">Geo-Resolution</a> areas directly without having to go back to the landing page.</p>
        
      <p>Underneath the menu bar is the <strong>tool bar</strong> <span class="image-marker">3</span>. This allows you to switch between different modes 
        of operation. Per default, you will start off in normal <span class="icon">&#xf040;</span> <strong>Toponym Annotation</strong> mode. Recogito's
        second annotation mode, <span class="icon">&#xf135;</span> <strong>Quick Toponym Annotation</strong>, will suppress the popup dialog. Every
        action you make is performed immediately, without the need to confirm. You will see that with a little bit of practice, this 'Rocket' mode will greatly speed up your
        work.</p> 
        
      <p>There are a few <strong>helper functions</strong> behind the scenes:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>When you annotate a place name, Recogito will search for <strong>additional exact matches</strong> in the text and propose tagging them
          automatically.</li>
          
        <li>Recogito will always (even in the Quick Annotation Mode) pop up a confirmation dialog in cases where your selection is very long. This is to
          avoid the loss of annotations that would occur should you accidentially have selected an entire paragraph (in which case all annotations in the paragraph
          would be merged into one).
          
        <li>Likewise, a confirmation dialog will pop up for very short selections. This is to avoid an excessive number of annotations being created 
          in cases where a very common word (such as 'and') has been selected accidentially and the automatic annotation of exact matches was too quickly
          confirmed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <a class="internal-anchor" name="geo-resolution"></a>
      <h3><span class="icon">&#xf0ac;</span> Geo-Resolution</h3>
      
      <p>After you have annotated a number of place names in your document, the next step is to <strong>geo-resolve</strong> them. Geo-resolution is the act
        of linking <em>place names</em> in a document to <em>places</em> in Recogito's internal place directory, so that they can be drawn on a map.
        Underneath the hood, Recogito attempts to establish such links automatically while place names are being tagged in the
        <a href="#text-annotation">Text Annotation area</a>. But these automatic mappings are not necessarily correct. The <strong>Geo-Resolution
        area</strong> (Fig. 3) is the place where you can verify or correct them, or establish mappings manually in case they are missing altogether.</p>

        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-georesolution.jpg">  
        <p>Fig.3 Geo-Resolution Area.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>The Geo-Resolution area is divided into two major sections: the <strong>toponym table</strong> <span class="image-marker">1</span> which lists
        all the place names that were tagged in the document, and the <strong>map</strong> <span class="image-marker">2</span> which displays the locations
        of those place names that are already linked to a place. At the bottom, there's a footer <span class="image-marker">3</span> showing some basic
        completion stats.</p>
