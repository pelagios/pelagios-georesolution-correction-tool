      <h3>Landing Page</h3>
      <p>The first thing you will see of Recogito is the <strong>landing page</strong> (Fig.1). This page, which is the 
        <strong>'public view'</strong>, provides an overview of the documents currently available in the system.</p>
      
      <div class="figure">
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-public-idx.png">  
        <p>Fig.1 Landing Page</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>Documents are grouped into different <strong>collections</strong>. You can navigate between them with the 
        <strong>collections menu</strong> on the left-hand side <span class="image-marker">1</span>. The <strong>document
        list</strong> <span class="image-marker">2</span> shows author, title and date information
        for each document. It also indicates the <strong>language</strong> of the document with a small label. (E.g. 'en'
        for English, 'la' for Latin, etc.) For some documents, there is a small <span class="icon">&#xf196;</span> 
        symbol at the start of the row. This means the document is available in multiple versions - typically translations 
        in different languages. Click the row to view all available versions.</p>
      
      <p>The number next to the language label is the <strong>total number of place names (toponyms)</strong> that have 
        been tagged in the text. Next to that, a colour-coded progress bar illustrates the <strong>rate of completion</strong>, 
        i.e. the percentage of those place names which have been successfully geo-located through a gazetteer (green) vs. 
        those where no gazetteer match could be found (yellow) vs. those place names that have not yet been verified. 
        Above the document list, there is a similar, larger bar that shows this information for the entire collection
        <span class="image-marker">3</span>.</p>
        
      <p>At the right-hand side of the document list, two buttons labeled <strong>Map</strong> and <strong>Download</strong>
        <span class="image-marker">4</span> allow you to view the geo-located place names for each document on a Web map, 
        and to download the raw data as a CSV file.</p>
    
      <p>If you now log in to Recogito through the <strong>button in the upper right hand corner</strong>, you will notice a small change in the landing page: instead of the 'Map' and
        'Download' buttons, there is now a row of icons. This means that you are now in the <strong>'editing suite'</strong>, which is where the annotation and geo-resolution of documents takes place. The icons here provide access to Recogito's different areas of activity (from left to right): 
        <a href="#document-stats"><span class="icon">&#xf080;</span> Document Stats</a>, <a href="#text-annotation"><span class="icon">&#xf0f6;</span> Text Annotation</a> and 
        <a href="#geo-resolution"><span class="icon">&#xf0ac;</span> Geo-Resoution</a>. The table icon <span class="icon">&#xf0ce;</span> again allows you to download
        the raw data as a CSV file. Note that it is possible for documents to have no text at all. In this case the Text Annotation icon will be
        greyed out.</p>
      
      <a class="internal-anchor" name="document-stats"></a>
      <h3><span class="icon">&#xf080;</span> Document Stats</h3>
      
      <p>This page lists basic statistics about the annotations on the document. At the moment, it is still a work in progress.</p>
      
      <a class="internal-anchor" name="text-annotation"></a>
      <h3><span class="icon">&#xf0f6;</span> Text Annotation</h3>
      
      <p>When you start working on a new document, this is usually where you will want to begin (Fig.2). You can annotate place names in the text by selecting
        them. Like in any word processing tool, you select by clicking and dragging with your mouse, or by double clicking on a word.
        After selecting a piece of text, a confirmation dialog will pop up to verify wether your want to annotate the selected text as a place name or not
        <span class="image-marker">1</span>.</p>
        
      <div class="figure">
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-annotation.png">  
        <p>Fig.2 Text Annotation Area</p>
      </div>
        
      <p>To delete an annotation, simply select it again. A popup dialog will ask for confirmation. Modifying an annotation (i.e. changing its
        start or end, or merging multiple annotations into one) is equally straightforward. Just select the place name the way you want it, and
        the popup dialog will ask you to confirm the change.</p>
        
      <div class="figure"><img src="images/popup-merge.png"></div>
       
      <p>Some documents consist of multiple texts. In this case, you can use the <strong>menu bar</strong> in the header to switch between them
        <span class="image-marker">2</span>. The menu bar also allows you to switch to the <a href="#document-stats">Document Stats</a> and
        <a href="#geo-resolution">Geo-Resolution</a> areas directly without having to go back to the landing page.</p>
        
      <p>Underneath the menu bar is the <strong>tool bar</strong> <span class="image-marker">3</span>. This allows you to switch between different modes 
        of operation. Per default, you will start off in normal <span class="icon">&#xf040;</span> <strong>Toponym Annotation</strong> mode. Recogito's
        second annotation mode, <span class="icon">&#xf135;</span> <strong>Quick Toponym Annotation</strong>, will suppress the popup dialog. Every
        action you make is performed immediately, without the need to confirm. You will see that with a little bit of practice, this 'Rocket' mode will greatly speed up your
        work.</p> 
        
      <p>There are a few <strong>helper functions</strong> behind the scenes:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>When you annotate a place name, Recogito will search for <strong>additional exact matches</strong> in the text and propose tagging them
          automatically.</li>
          
        <li>Recogito will always (even in the Quick Annotation Mode) pop up a confirmation dialog in cases where your selection is very long. This is to
          avoid the loss of annotations that would occur should you accidentially have selected an entire paragraph (in which case all annotations in the paragraph
          would be merged into one).
          
        <li>Likewise, a confirmation dialog will pop up for very short selections. This is to avoid an excessive number of annotations being created 
          in cases where a very common word (such as 'and') has been selected accidentially and the automatic annotation of exact matches was too quickly
          confirmed.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <a class="internal-anchor" name="geo-resolution"></a>
      <h3><span class="icon">&#xf0ac;</span> Geo-Resolution</h3>
      
      <p>After you have annotated a number of place names in your document, the next step is to <strong>geo-resolve</strong> them. Geo-resolution is the act
        of linking <em>place names</em> in a document to <em>places</em> in Recogito's internal place directory, so that they can be drawn on a map.
        Underneath the hood, Recogito attempts to establish such links automatically while place names are being tagged in the
        <a href="#text-annotation">Text Annotation area</a>. But these automatic mappings are not necessarily correct. The <strong>Geo-Resolution
        area</strong> (Fig. 3) is the place where you can verify or correct them, or establish mappings manually in case they are missing altogether.</p>
        
      <div class="figure">
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-georesolution.jpg">  
        <p>Fig.3 Geo-Resolution Area</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>The Geo-Resolution area is divided into two major sections: the <strong>toponym table</strong> <span class="image-marker">1</span> which lists
        all the place names that were tagged in the document, and the <strong>map</strong> <span class="image-marker">2</span> which displays the locations
        of those place names that are already linked to a place. At the bottom, there's a footer <span class="image-marker">3</span> showing some basic
        completion stats.</p>
        
      <p>The <strong>toponym table</strong> lists all place names in sequence. (Initally in the order they appear in the text. But it is also possible 
        to change the sort order to alphabetic by clicking on the <em>Toponym</em> column header field, and back to sequential order by clicking 
        the <em>#</em> column header). You can adapt the width of each column by clicking and dragging the border of its column header field. The columns
        list:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>the <strong>place name</strong> as it appears in the text. Hover over the text to get a preview snippet that shows the toponym in the context of the source text.</li>
        <li>the <strong>document part</strong> (if the document consists of multiple texts).</li>
        <li>any <strong>tags</strong> you may have added to the place name (see below for more information on tags).</li>
        <li>the <strong>automatic geo-resolution</strong> produced by Recogito, if any. The geo-resolution is typically displayed as a Gazetteer shortcode. Hover 
          over the code with your mouse to see the place title as recorded in Recogito's internal place directory.</li>
        <li>the <strong>manual (or corrected) geo-resolution</strong>, if any.</li>
        <li>the <strong>verification status</strong> of the place name. If you hover the mouse over the status, a small 'quick access' menu will allow you to
          change the verification status with a single click (see below for more information about verification status)</li>
      </ul> 
      
      <p>The <strong>map</strong> shows markers for the geo-resolved place names. Click and drag the map to pan it, use your mouse wheel or the plus/minus control
        (top left) to zoom it. Use the basemap control underneath the plus/minus control to change between different background maps. If your 
        document consists of multiple parts, a layer switcher (top right) allows you to switch markers for different document parts on and off individually.</p>
      
      <div class="figure"><img src="images/sequence-line.jpg"></div>
        
      <p>Selection between map and toponym table is synchronized: clicking a marker on a map will highlight all occurrences of this place in the toponym table (and scroll
        the table to the first occurence in the text); clicking a row in the table will select the corresponding marker on the map. When a place is selected, the map 
        will display a <strong>sequence line</strong> that connects it with it's previous and next two geo-resolved neighbours in the text. That way it is often much easier
        to spot outliers (which may be due to incorrect geo-resolution), especially if you use your up and down arrow keys to step through place names sequentially, after
        selecting one in the toponym table.</p>
      
      <h4>Editing a Place Name's Details</h4>
      
      <p>Double-clicking on a table row will open a <strong>window with details</strong> about the place name, how it appears in the text,
        and how it is linked to a place in Recogito (Fig. 4). This window also allows you to change incorrect links, and add additional
        information about the place name, e.g. tags or comments.</p>
      
      <div class="figure">
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/screenshot-details.jpg">  
        <p>Fig.4 Toponym Details</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>The main component of the details window is a map <span class="image-marker">1</span>. If the place name is already geo-resolved, the
        map shows the corresponding place (again connected to it's nearest neighbour places in the text through a sequence line). Underneath
        the map, Recogito suggests other potential places that may match the place name <span class="image-marker">2</span>. You can link the 
        place name to one of the alternative suggestions by simply clicking on it. If no find that none of the suggestions is correct, you
        can try to find a match using the text search field <span class="image-marker">3</span>.</p>
        
      <p>The top-right of the details window shows information about the automatic link that has initially been assigned by Recogito, if any
        <span class="image-marker">4</span>, as well as the latest manual assignment <span class="image-marker">5</span></p>
