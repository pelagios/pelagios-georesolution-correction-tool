# Behaim Grid
 
__Warning:__ despite the .jpg extension, the behaim grid tiles are actually PNG files. This is because
OpenLayers does not support Zoomify PNG tiles, but forces Zoomify URLs to a .jpg extensions. The browser
(Chrome/Firefox at least) doesn't seem to care though and displays them just fine as transparent JPEGs.
